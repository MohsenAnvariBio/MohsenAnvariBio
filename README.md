# About Me

I am an Embedded Software Engineer with a strong background in real-time systems, biomedical signal processing, and microcontroller-based product development. I specialize in designing and implementing firmware for STM32 (Cortex-M) platforms using C/C++, FreeRTOS, and low-level driver development (HAL, LL, and bare-metal). With two Master’s degrees in Biomedical Engineering (Bioelectric) and Communications & Signal Processing, I bring a unique combination of algorithmic thinking, hardware understanding, and system-level engineering to embedded applications—especially in the biomedical domain.

#### My expertise includes:

- Real-time data acquisition and sensor integration (I²C, SPI, UART, CAN)  
- Wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy - BLE) on embedded devices  
- Embedded signal processing for ECG/PPG and other biosignals  
- Low-power embedded design and MCU sleep strategies  
- Architecting clean firmware using FreeRTOS, state machines, and modular design

I have professional experience in both research and industry, including biomedical device prototyping, firmware development for STM32, and Android application development for wireless real-time visualization.  
I enjoy transforming ideas into robust embedded systems, building reliable firmware from the ground up, and continuously improving my skills in real-time embedded design.
#### Current Focus:
Developing and refining a real-time biosignal monitoring system. Signals are filtered on-board and transmitted via BLE to an Android app for live visualization, logging, and basic analysis.
Here are the main tools and technologies I work with:
